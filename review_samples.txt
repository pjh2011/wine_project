2005 Château Cos d'Estournel

Drank in London
Fully open and singing beautifully. Classic Cos notes with a wonderful depth and peacock tail on the the palate. Lovely.

Nose with red currant, cherries, cassis, smoke, dusty gravel, lead pencil, dry graphite, cedar wood, some nice herbs and spices.
Palate shows sappy and rich dark fruit, dusty minerals, cedar wood and tobacco leafs, spices and minerals.
Great structure and length.

No Fools Today (Minneapolis): Very modern but very good. Cherry, spices, oak, vanilla and dark fruits. Long finish and super complex wine. Should improve with some age but showing well with an hour plus decant. Groups wine of the night.

nose - plum and floral
mouth - juicy, cassis, blackberry, very long, elegant, and still with very much fresh fruit. will only get better
